# This file tells Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading.Analyzers what types require the main thread

# The following types require the main thread because instances of these types are passed in by
# Visual Studio as COM objects. These objects can cause deadlocks if they are cast or their methods
# are invoked while the main thread is waiting for a JoinableTask to complete.

# In the attach-to-process flow we provide our own implementations of IDebugProcess2 and
# IDebugProgram2 (through DebugPortSupplier), but in the run-and-debug and attach-to-core flows we
# still receive Visual Studio-provided instances.

# The following types are factories that have arguments that are ultimately passed in by Visual
# Studio as COM objects. These factories are wrapped in proxies that are not safe to use off the
# main thread, due to a design flaw in Castle.DynamicProxy.
# TODO: Make Castle.DynamicProxy avoid casting COM objects.
